## What are my strengths
- Feedback Analysis is the only way to identify your strengths.
- Write down expected outcomes for your key decisions and actions. 9 to twelve months later, compare them with the results.
- Action plan:
    - Put yourself where your strengths can produce results
    - Work to improve your strengths
    - Avoid intellectual arrogance – acquire skills as required
    - Remedy bad habits; have no lack of manners
    - Know what not to do – identify incompetence areas and avoid them

Know what you are good at - A person can perform only from strengths. One cannot build
performance on weaknesses, let alone something one cannot do at all.

## How do I perform
As any personality trait – How a person performs is a given, just as what
a person is good at or not good at

### Am I a “reader” or a “listener”?
- A reader, such as the US President Kennedy or Secretory McNamara, prefers
educating oneself by reading reports before press meetings and discussions
- A listener, such as the US President Roosevelt, likes to face it and talking the
matter out aloud instead of preparatory reading or writing
- A reader can not fully become a listener–and vice versa
### How do I learn?
- A person may learn by reading, writing, doing, talking, listening to, or a
combination thereof
- One must always employ the methods that work

Do not try to change yourself too much –
instead, work harder to improve the way you perform

## What are my values
The mirror test: Ethics require that you ask yourself, “What kind of person
do I want to see in the mirror in the morning?”

Personal value system should be compatible with that of the
organization’s. The typical conflicts to avoid are:
- Organization’s commitment to new vs. old employees
- Incremental improvements or risky breakthroughs
- Emphasis on short-term results vs. long-term goals
- Quality vs. Quantity, and Growth vs. Sustenance

In other words, values are, and should be, the ultimate test for your
compatibility with an organization

## Where do I belong
Highly gifted people must realize early where do they belong, or rather
where do they not belong

Successful careers are not planned:
- Successful careers develop when people are prepared for opportunities because they know their strengths, their method of work, and their values
- Knowing where one belongs can transform an ordinary person – hardworking and competent but otherwise mediocre – into an outstanding performer

Mathematicians, Musicians and Cooks are usually –
mathematicians, musicians and cooks by the time they are four or five years old…

## What should I contribute
### A knowledge worker’s quest on contribution involves:
- What does the situation require?
- Given my strengths, methods, and values, what is the great contribution that I can make to what needs to be done?
- What results have to be achieved to make a real difference? 

### It’s rarely possible to look too far ahead – 18 months should be planned to
- Achieve meaningful results and make a difference
- Set stretched and difficult goals that are reachable
- Gain visible and measurable outcome

Define the course of action – What to do;where and how to start; and what goals, objectives,
deadlines to set

## Responsibility of relationships
Bosses are neither the ‘title’ on the Org chart nor the ‘function’ – to adapt to what makes the boss more effective is the secret of
“managing the boss” 

Working relationships are as much based on people as on work – co-workers are as much human and individuals as you are

Taking the responsibility of communicating how you perform
reduces personality conflicts

Organizations are built on trust between people – not necessarily meaning that they like each other – but that they understand one another

## Summary
In the knowledge industry,
- Mostly, success is at best an absence of failure
- Knowledge workers outlive the organizations
- Knowledge workers are mobile, and may not stay put
- The need to manage oneself is therefore creating a revolution in human affairs

Managing oneself requires new and unprecedented things from the individual – to the point where each knowledge worker thinks and behaves like a CEO
